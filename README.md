- HTML

## Modified Website: file:///Users/abelmartinez/Desktop/projects/horiseon-clean-up/index.html 

## Description of job 
Horiseon wanted to make sure website was accessible for all humans. I made sure other developers could read the code easily by adding semantic html tags to the main section and footer. 
Also the CSS style tags were consolidated at the head section and footer section.
